# Python does not have a built-in interface keyword like Java or C#. However, we can achieve interface-like behavior using abstract classes with only abstract methods.

# ðŸ”¹ Why Use Interfaces?
# Ensures that multiple unrelated classes follow a common structure.
# Encourages polymorphism (different classes with the same methods).
# Helps decouple implementation from design.
